# DiOS
A very basic, amateur OS made entirely in x86 assembly.
This project is just a challenge I put on myself for fun, because why not.
Also I love coding in assembly and making your own OS with it is the best
way in my opinion.

# Requirements
- Windows, Linux or MacOS
- Qemu for x86 system emulation (`qemu-system-i386`)
- The Intel x86 Nasm assembler (`nasm`)
