# DiOS
A very basic, amateur OS made entirely in x86 assembly.
This project is just a challenge I put on myself for fun, because why not.
Also I love coding in assembly and making your own OS with it is the best
way in my opinion.

# Requirements
- Linux or MacOS
- Qemu for system emulation (`qemu-system-x86_64`)
- The Intel x86 Nasm assembler (`nasm`)
